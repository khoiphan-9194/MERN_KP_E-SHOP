# MERN_KP_E-SHOP

MERN_KP_E-SHOP is a full-stack e-commerce application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This project demonstrates a modern approach to building scalable and maintainable web applications.
## About This Application

MERN_KP_E-SHOP is designed as a comprehensive e-commerce platform, enabling users to browse products, manage their shopping cart, and place orders securely. The application features robust user authentication and authorization using JWT, ensuring secure access to user-specific data and actions. Administrators can manage products, view orders, and handle user accounts through dedicated interfaces.

Key highlights include:

- **User Experience:** A responsive and intuitive frontend built with React and Bootstrap, providing seamless navigation across devices.
- **Product Catalog:** Dynamic product listing with search and filter capabilities, detailed product pages, and inventory management.
- **CRUD Operations:** Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality for products, users, and orders, allowing both users and administrators to manage resources efficiently.
- **Shopping Cart:** Persistent cart functionality allowing users to add, update, or remove products before checkout.
- **Order Management:** Users can view their order history, track order status, and receive notifications upon successful transactions.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Admins have access to product CRUD operations, order management, and user account controls.
- **API Design:** RESTful API endpoints built with Express and Node.js, ensuring modularity and scalability.
- **Security:** Passwords are hashed with bcrypt, and sensitive routes are protected using JWT-based authentication.
- **Data Handling:** MongoDB and Mongoose are used for efficient data modeling and storage.

This project serves as a solid foundation for learning or extending a modern e-commerce solution using the MERN stack.
